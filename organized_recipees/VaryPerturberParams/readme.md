# Goal

In this folder, I will run simulations in which I vary both: 
    - the parameters of the host cluster
    - the parameters of the impactor

specficially, I want to see what happens replacing the cluster parameters with sub-halo parameters.

In essence, I will choose four different parameters, two radii and two masses
